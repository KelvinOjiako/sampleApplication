# sampleApplication
An experimental approach to full stack development that utilzes Kotlin Multiplatform (not yet stable). Uses Kotlin/JS for the frontend and Kotlin/JVM for the backend, utilizing the Ktor Serverside framework.

A sample attempt at a server side rendered Single Page application that is SEO friendly. This is leveraged through the Kotlin DSL's ability to make type safe HTML pages.
So although the Server is always returning the same index.html page, that page is dynamic and hence an empty page isnt initially being rendered to client.
